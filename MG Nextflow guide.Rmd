# Intro

This is a quick and dirty guide on how I use Nextflow.
It is primarily for my use but if someone else finds it I hope it will also proof useful. 
Additionally, this was made with R Bookdown.

# Concepts

## Workflow

Nextflow is used to create workflows.
A workflow consists of multiple __processes__.
Each __process__ has __input__ and __output__.

A __process__ will not start until it has all the __input__ it requires.
This is important as a process will therefore wait till other __processes__ are finished if the __output__ of other __processes__ are the __input__ for the __process__.

In the nextflow script each process is created in the main script body (or in a separate `main.nf` file).

These __processes__ are then called in the __workflow__.

Example `main.nf`

```{bash, eval=FALSE }
#!/usr/bin/env nextflow
/*
  *Params
*/
params.dir = "."
params.input1 = "input.txt"
/*
  * Processes
*/
process STEP1 {
  input:
    path(input_data)
  output:
    path("output1.txt")
}
process STEP2 {
  input:
    path(input_data)
  output:
      path("output2.txt")
}
/*
  * workflow
*/
workflow {
  /// Set input param to channel
  input1_ch=file(params.input1)
  /// Process 1
  step1(input1_ch)
  /// Process 2
  step2(step1.out)
}
``` 

## Variables

Nextflow __Variables__ are used across a nextflow script.
Within the `script` section of a `process` block they are denoted by `$` (e.g. `$sample_id`).

__Variable__ names cannot start with numbers.

Bash __variables__ within a `script` section must be denoted by a `\` (e.g. `\$var`).

## Channels, tuples, & lists

__Channels__, __tuples__, and __lists__ are objects that contain multiple objects but work in different ways.

### Channels

__Channels__ are specified and used in the __workflow__ section. 
A __Channel__ contains a number of __values__.
Each __value__ passes through a process separately, this is carried out via parallelisation.

Example:

- A __Channel__ called `integers_ch` contains the 10 values 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, & 9.
- A process called `multiple_by_10` multiples input by 10.
- If the __Channel__ `integers_ch` was used as the input for the __process__ `multiple_by_10` the output woudl be a __Channel__ of 10 values containing the __values__ 10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80, & 90.

### Tuples & Lists

__Tuples__ & __Lists__ are used within __process__ blocks.
There are many ways to create and manipulate them within and without __process blocks__.

Confusingly __Tuples__ & __Lists__ are both structured as `[value_1,value_2,value_3]`.

#### Tuples

__Tuples__ contain multiple values with each value assigned as a separate variable in a process.
This allows you to input/output data which should be grouped together.
The below example shows how to group sample ids with their paired fastq reads.

```{bash, eval=FALSE }
process step1 {
  input:
    tuple val(sample_id), path(r1), path(r2)
  output:
    tuple val(sample_id), path("${sample_id}_r1_trimmed.fastq"), path("${sample_id}_r2_trimmed.fastq")
  script:
  """
  trim -i1 $r1 -i2 $r2 \
  -o1 ${sample_id}_r1_trimmed.fastq -o2 ${sample_id}_r2_trimmed.fastq
  """
}
```

This is important as multiple __Channels__ with multiple __values__ are not ordered relative to each other.

#### Lists

When a __List__ is used within a __script__ block all the __values__ will be used together with a space (` `) between each value.

Example:

The __Channel__ `r1_fastqs_ch` contains the __List__ `["S1_R1.fastq","S2_R1.fastq","S3_R1.fastq"]`

The below truncated nextflow script to run fastqc....

```{bash, eval=FALSE }
process r1_fastqc {
  input:
    path(r1s)
  output:
    .....
  script:
  """
  fastqc -o fastqc_output \
  $r1s
  """
}
workflow {
  r1_fastqc(r1_fastqs_ch)
}
```

Would be run as:

```{bash, eval=FALSE }
fastqc -o fastqc_output \
S1_R1.fastq S2_R1.fastq S3_R1.fastq
```

#### Combinations

Of course you can have a __Channel__ that can contain multiple __Tuples__ and/or __Lists__. Additionally __Tuples__ can contain __Lists__.

# Basic layout

When using Nextflow each project should be within its own directory.

Within the main directory of the project you will have all the Nextflow files you need.

There are many Nextflow files you can have but the only essential file is a main `.nf` file which many people like to name as `main.nf`.

This chapter will go over a basic `main.nf` file and its different parts.

## `main.nf`

The `main.nf` is a plain text file that contains Nextflow code.
Below is an example:

```{bash, eval=FALSE }
#!/usr/bin/env nextflow
/*
  *Params
*/
params.dir = "."
params.outdir = "./results"
params.input_file = "/path/to/data/input.txt"

/*
  * Processes
*/
process STEP1 {
  publishDir:
    params.outdir, mode: 'copy'
  input:
    path(input_data)
  output:
    path("output1.txt")
  script:
  """
  create_output -i $input_data -o output1.txt
  """
}

process STEP2 {
  publishDir:
    params.outdir, mode: 'copy'
  input:
    path(input_data)
  output:
    path("output2.txt")
  script:
  """
  create_output_2 -i $input_data -o output2.txt
  """
}

/*
  * workflow
*/
workflow {
  /// Set input params to channels
  input_ch=file(params.input_file)
  /// Process 1
  STEP1(input_ch)
  /// Process 2
  STEP2(step1.out)
}
``` 

## Params

The first section is the various initial parameters. This is useful for specifying input information for the workflow including:

- Input & output directories
- Input data
- Metadata information
- Reference files

Any time they are used anywhere within the script they must include `params.` as a prefix.

## Processes

__Processes__ are how the tasks of a workflow are specified and have many parts.

[__Process reference__](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/reference/process.html#process-reference)

### Initialistion

A __process__ is defined by `process NAME` and the __process__ body is cotnained with `{}`.

The __Process__ name is arbitrary and decided by the workflow designer.
However some suggestions are:

- Do not start the name with numbers.
- Capitalise all letters used, this is normal convention and makes it easier to see what are __processes__ in your __workflow__ block.
- Separate words with `_`.
- Ensure all process names are unique and somewhat descriptive within your workflow.

### publishDir

All files created by the __Process__ will be contained with the workflow's `work` directory (more info later).
All files specified in the `output` section will be stored in the directory specified by `publishDir`, if the directory does not exist Nextflow will create it.
The output data is stored in the specified based on the `mode:`.

The modes are:

- `copy`: Copies the output files into the publish directory.
- `copyNoFollow`: Copies the output files into the publish directory without following symlinks ie. copies the links themselves.
- `link`: Creates a hard link in the publish directory for each output file.
- `move`: Moves the output files into the publish directory. Note: this is only supposed to be used for a terminal process i.e. a process whose output is not consumed by any other downstream process.
- `rellink`: Creates a relative symbolic link in the publish directory for each output file.
- `symlink`: Creates an absolute symbolic link in the publish directory for each output file (default).

More info on [`publishDir`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/reference/process.html#publishdir)

### input

These specify the input names and type.
Input names are arbitrary but should follow variables rules.

The 2 basic input types are:

- `path`: Specifies paths, generally poiting to files.
- `val`: Specifies values, these are generally text or numbers such as sample ids.

### output

These specify the output.

If the output is a file it needs to be the actual name of the output file in quotes (double quotes are normally preferred).

### script

The script block, denoted by flanking triple double quotes (`"""`), contains the code the __process__ will carry out.
By default this will be `bash` code.

Input variables can be denoted by a `$` and output variables are written like normal script but can also use input variables such as sample ids.

## workflow
The workflow section is where all the other sections come together so the workflow knows how to utilise them.
