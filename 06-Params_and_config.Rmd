# Params and config

This section includes some extra features related to __params__ and the __config__ file.

A full link of config info can be seen in the [nextflow docs](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html)

## Params

Workflow parameters can be set at the top of the primary `main.nf` file.

```{bash, eval=FALSE }
/*
 * Params
*/
params.dir = "."
params.outdir = "./results"
params.sample_name = "Sample_1"
params.fastqs = "/home/data/project123/raw_fastqs"
params.database = "/home/dbs/db123/db123.fastq"
params.conda_env = "/home/conda/envs/example_env"
params.rscript = "./rscripts/summary.rscript"
```

### Params to channel

When using params containing a file in the workflow it is common practice to convert them to a channel.

```{bash, eval=FALSE }
workflow {
  database_ch = file(params.database)
}
```

## Config

You can contain a lot of info in a config file.

Your primary config file should be in the same directory as your primary `main.nf` file and should be named `nextflow.config`.
This will cause it to be used when you `nextflow run main.nf -resume`.

### Params in config

You can include your `params` in your config file.

```{bash, eval=FALSE }
params {
  dir = "."
  outdir = "./results"
  sample_name = "Sample_1"
  fastqs = "/home/data/project123/raw_fastqs"
  database = "/home/dbs/db123/db123.fastq"
  conda_env = "/home/conda/envs/example_env"
  rscript = "./rscripts/summary.rscript"
}
```

Ensure you still use `params.` as a prefux in the various `.nf` files.
